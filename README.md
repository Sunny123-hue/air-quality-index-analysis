# 🌍 Air Quality Index (AQI) Worldwide Monitoring

A data analysis and machine learning project for monitoring and predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) levels worldwide using pollutant data such as **PM2.5**, **NO2**, **CO**, and more.

## 📊 Project Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global air quality data
- Visualizations of pollutant trends
- Correlation analysis between pollutants and AQI
- Machine Learning models to predict AQI levels
- Dataset includes pollution data with country-wise AQI levels

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Colab

## 📁 Files in the Repository
